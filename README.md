# Adobe Commerce Bold Checkout Integration

This extension replaces the built-in Adobe Commerce checkout experience with Bold Checkout.

The Bold Checkout extension supports Adobe Commerce (formerly known as Magento 2) and Magento Open Source stores.

## Install the Bold Checkout extension

Installation instructions depend on how your checkout is hosted. Refer to the developer documentation below.

- [Bold-hosted](https://developer.boldcommerce.com/default/guides/platform-integration/adobe-commerce/installation): Use the pre-built, optimized, three-page checkout experience provided by Bold.
- [Self-hosted](https://developer.boldcommerce.com/guides/platform-integration/adobe-commerce/self-hosted-checkout): Use a custom checkout for a more customized experience.
